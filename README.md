# 🎯 Binary Search Problem Collection: Beginner to Advanced 🚀

Welcome to the **Binary Search Problem Collection**! This repository contains a curated set of binary search problems categorized by patterns, difficulty, and use cases.

Whether you're just starting out or refining your edge case intuition, this list will guide you through mastering binary search in 1D, 2D, and even on answers.

Apart from this this repository also contains custom implementation of `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` functions of CPP STL library.
